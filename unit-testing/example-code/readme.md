# Calculator Project for GitHub Copilot Unit Testing Demos

This directory contains a fully functional **Calculator** built with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. The purpose of this directory is to provide a ready-to-use example for creating unit tests in GitHub Copilot. The calculator can be downloaded and leveraged as a demonstration project to showcase GitHub Copilot’s capabilities in generating unit tests for JavaScript functions.

---

## Project Overview

This Calculator project includes:
- **HTML**: A basic layout for the calculator interface.
- **CSS**: Styling for a clean and user-friendly appearance.
- **JavaScript**: Core logic for handling basic arithmetic operations.

---

## Features

The Calculator supports the following operations:
1. **Addition**
2. **Subtraction**
3. **Multiplication**
4. **Division**

Each of these operations is implemented as a function in JavaScript, making them easy to target with unit tests.

## Purpose of this Directory

This project is designed as a **tool for creating unit tests** with GitHub Copilot, specifically:
- **Copilot Unit Testing Demonstrations**: Showcase Copilot’s ability to generate unit tests for JavaScript functions.
- **Learning Resource**: Provide an accessible example for developers learning how to write or improve their unit testing skills.
- **Reusable Demo Asset**: The project can be downloaded and set up immediately, making it perfect for recurring demos and tutorials.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Download the Project**: Clone this directory or download it as a ZIP file.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abel-org/copilot-hub

2. **Open the Calculator**:
   - Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view and use the calculator interface.
   - This provides a visual, interactive calculator for testing and exploration.

3. **Set Up for Unit Testing**:
   - This project is optimized for JavaScript unit testing using popular frameworks like **Jest** or **Mocha**.
   - Import the calculator functions from `calculator.js` in your test file to target each operation for unit testing.

4. **Generating Unit Tests with Copilot**:
   - Open your JavaScript test file in a supported editor like Visual Studio Code.
   - Use GitHub Copilot to generate unit tests by prompting it with comments or specific test requirements.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     // Test for addition function
     ```
   - Copilot can provide suggestions for test cases based on the calculator functions, saving time and improving test coverage.

5. **Run Unit Tests**:
   - If using Jest, you can run tests by executing:
     ```bash
     npm test
     ```
   - Ensure that all calculator functions are covered with appropriate test cases for thorough testing.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the calculator interface.
- `style.css`: CSS file for styling the calculator interface.
- `calculator.js`: JavaScript file containing the core calculator functions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- `tests/`: Directory (optional) for storing test files if using a testing framework like Jest or Mocha.

---

## Additional Notes

- **GitHub Copilot Tips**: Copilot can assist in creating robust unit tests, handling edge cases, and suggesting improvements to your test coverage.
- **Modifications**: Feel free to modify or extend the calculator functions to add more features or test additional scenarios.
